# Project 2 Proposal:
# Group 1: Christine Hall, Eduardo Panneflek, Jonathan Caro, Daniel De la Torre

Topic - Olympic Sports and Medals (1896-2014)  

# Repository Link: - https://github.com/CD-JCaro/Project-2

Rationale: 
When brainstorming where our group wanted to source datasets for our project, we identified Kaggle as the best option to explore. After exploring what resources Kaggle had to offer and briefly discussing what we wanted to do, we opted to look into the type of datasets that contained Olympic Games data.  

Scrolling through Kaggle's public datasets, we found a dataset that contained Olympic Sports and Medals from the years 1896-2014. 

Dataset files include: 

dictionary.csv
summer.csv
winter.csv 

As a group given that this dataset has both summer and winter games data, we feel it would be best to source both datasets for our project. The rationale behind this decision is because we firmly believe that a broader approach to medal haul is more indicative of a country's overall historical Olympic performance. 

Expectation & End Result: 

Our expectation is to create an interactive dashboard that includes interactive front-end filters. These filters will act as a means of filtering our cleaned data dependent on the parameters given. Filters will include a start and end year text box filter, a filter by season, a filter by year, a filter by country, a filter by gender, a filter by sport, and a filter by medal type.

Our result differed slightly from what we first envisioned as it includes a filter by start and end year, by country, by sport, and by olympic season. Our group felt that some of our initial filter ideas proved to be unnecessary, including filter by gender and filter by medal. We can see breakdowns of these subcategories in the form of other visualizations, and we have a clean breakdown by gender in the form of our kiwi visualization.
